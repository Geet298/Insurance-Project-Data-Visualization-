# Insurance-Project-Data-Visualization
In this project, I am trying to explore and identify the factors that contribute to higher medical costs. For this analysis, I am working with the insurance.csv dataset, which contains information about individual medical costs billed by health insurance companies, along with some personal details of the individuals.

Data Description
• age: age of primary beneficiary
• sex: insurance contractor gender, 1 (female), 0 (male)
• bmi: body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights
that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body
weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to
24.9
• children: number of children covered by health insurance / number of
dependents
• smoker: 1 (smoking), 0 (non-smoking)
• region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US,
0 (southwest), 1(southeast), 2 (northwest), 3 (northeast)
• charges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance

To complete the assignment, I have performed the following steps:

1. BMI Impact on Medical Costs:
   - Plotted a scatter plot with BMI on the x-axis and medical costs on the y-axis.
   - Assigned different colors to the points based on whether the patient is a smoker.
   - Set the transparency to 0.7.
   - Included a colorbar with appropriate labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and colorbar.
   - Analyzed the plot to derive business insights regarding the impact of BMI on medical costs.

2. Distribution of Medical Costs for Smokers and Non-Smokers:
   - Plotted two histograms on the same figure.
   - First, plotted the distribution of medical costs for smokers.
   - Then, plotted the distribution of medical costs for non-smokers with a transparency of 0.6.
   - Set the number of bins to 12 for both histograms.
   - Set appropriate labels and legends for the plot.
   - Analyzed the plot to compare the medical costs between smokers and non-smokers.

3. Comparison of Medical Costs for Young and Elder People:
   - Plotted a histogram to represent the distribution of medical costs for patients younger than 40 years old.
   - Plotted another histogram on the same plot to represent the distribution of medical costs for the rest of the patients.
   - Set the transparency of the second histogram to 0.7.
   - Set the number of bins to 15 for both histograms.
   - Set appropriate labels and legends for the plot.
   - Analyzed the plot to compare the medical costs between young and elder people.

4. Open-Ended Analysis:
   - Utilized data visualization skills to discover additional insights from the dataset.
   - Generated two more figures to showcase the findings.
   - Provided explanations and interpretations of the findings.

By following these steps, I have successfully analyzed the provided insurance dataset, visualized the relationships between different variables, and drawn valuable insights regarding the impact of BMI, smoking status, age, and other factors on medical costs.
